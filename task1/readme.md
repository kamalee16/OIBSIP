# Advanced Voice Assistant (Python)

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an advanced Python-based voice assistant capable of understanding spoken commands and performing multiple real-world tasks such as telling time and date, fetching weather updates, answering general knowledge questions, controlling smart devices (simulated), setting reminders, and performing web searches using voice input.


## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Initialized speech recognition and text-to-speech engines.
2. Implemented voice input handling using a microphone with noise adjustment.
3. Added text-to-speech responses for user interaction.
4. Integrated date and time functionality using Python’s `datetime` module.
5. Implemented real-time weather updates using the OpenWeather API.
6. Enabled reminder and alarm functionality using time delays.
7. Simulated smart device control using voice commands.
8. Integrated Wikipedia API to answer general knowledge questions.
9. Added web search functionality via the default browser.
10. Created a command-processing system to identify and execute user requests continuously.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3
- SpeechRecognition – for voice input processing  
- pyttsx3 – for text-to-speech conversion  
- Wikipedia API – for general knowledge responses  
- OpenWeather API – for live weather updates  
- Requests – for API communication  
- Webbrowser – for online searches  
- Datetime & Time modules – for time, date, and reminders  



## ✅ Outcome
The project successfully delivers a fully functional advanced voice assistant that listens to user commands, processes them intelligently, and responds using natural speech. It demonstrates the practical use of speech recognition, APIs, and automation in building interactive AI-based applications.
