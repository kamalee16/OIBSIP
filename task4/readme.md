# Advanced Weather App 🌦️

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a desktop-based weather application using Python that allows users to fetch real-time weather information for any city or their current location. The app provides temperature details, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and dynamically switches between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.



## Steps Performed
1. Designed a graphical user interface (GUI) using **Tkinter**.
2. Integrated the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch real-time weather data.
3. Implemented city-based weather search functionality.
4. Added location-based weather detection using IP address.
5. Enabled temperature unit switching between **Celsius (°C)** and **Fahrenheit (°F)**.
6. Displayed weather icons dynamically based on current conditions.
7. Handled user input validation and error messages for better usability.



## Tools Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI development)
- Requests (API calls)
- Pillow (PIL) (Image handling)
- OpenWeatherMap API
- IP-API (Location detection)



## Outcome
The final application successfully displays accurate, real-time weather information through an intuitive desktop interface. Users can easily search for weather updates by city name or automatically detect their location, view weather icons, and switch temperature units seamlessly.
